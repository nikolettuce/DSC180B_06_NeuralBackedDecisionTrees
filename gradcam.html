                Grad-CAM is a popular technique for visualizing the parts of an image that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is looking.
                
            </h2>
            <p>
                We applied functional Grad-CAM code on the 
                <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/snakeclef2021-snake-species-identification-challenge/dataset_files"> AiCrowd Snake Classification Challenge</a>
                dataset. The goal of the
                Grad-CAM algorithm is to get a better understanding of image classification through visual
                explanations. Grad-CAM works by computing the gradient of a
                target class with respect to feature maps. This is because putting the average gradient through
                Global Average Pooling (GAP) will generate weights which measure the importance of such
                feature maps for a target class. This will lead to better localization than other algorithms such as
                CAM. The outcome is the heatmap which visualizes the weighted combination of feature maps,
                meaning that parts of the image which are considered significant are highlighted.
