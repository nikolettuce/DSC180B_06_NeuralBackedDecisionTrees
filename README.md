Our project focuses on building explanable image classification models on snake images from https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/snakeclef2021-snake-species-identification-challenge/dataset_files. Our plan is to apply gradcam to images of different snake species, construct a Densenet, and transform them into decision trees to visualize the classification process. 

## Installation

To use this project, please run build.sh and allocate at least 30 GB of hard drive space to install the data.

Then run python run.py data to first process the data before using the test target

To run the CNN and test on the snake dataset, run python run.py test
