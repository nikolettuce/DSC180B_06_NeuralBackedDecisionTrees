Our project focuses on building explanable image classification models on snake images from https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/snakeclef2021-snake-species-identification-challenge/dataset_files. Our plan is to apply gradcam to images of different snake species, construct a Densenet, and transform them into decision trees to visualize the classification process.
